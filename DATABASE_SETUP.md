# Database Setup Guide - Jeen Mata Impex

## ‚úÖ Completed Setup

I have successfully set up the complete database infrastructure for your application:

### üìÅ Files Created:
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Supabase client configuration with TypeScript types
- `src/lib/database.ts` - Database service layer with all CRUD operations
- `database/schema.sql` - Complete database schema with all tables, indexes, and RLS policies
- `database/seed.sql` - Sample data for testing and development
- `environment.env` - Environment variables template
- Updated `src/lib/entities/index.ts` - Replaced mock data with real database operations

## üöÄ Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Create Supabase Project
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Wait for the project to be fully provisioned
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí API to get your project URL and API keys

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables
1. Copy `environment.env` to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   copy environment.env .env.local
   ```
2. Update `.env.local` with your actual Supabase credentials:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here
   ```

### 3. Create Database Schema
1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the contents of `database/schema.sql`
3. Click "Run" to create all tables, indexes, and security policies

### 4. Seed Initial Data (Optional)
1. In the SQL Editor, copy and paste the contents of `database/seed.sql`
2. Click "Run" to populate the database with sample data

### 5. Test the Connection
1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. The application should now connect to your Supabase database instead of using mock data

## üìä Database Schema Overview

### Tables Created:
- **users** - User accounts with roles (admin, dealer, user)
- **brands** - Product brands (FastDrill, Spider, etc.)
- **categories** - Product categories (Power Tools, Hand Tools, etc.)
- **products** - Products with variants and pricing
- **dealer_applications** - Dealer registration applications
- **orders** - Orders and inquiries from dealers
- **shipments** - Shipment tracking information

### Key Features:
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** - Secure data access based on user roles
- **Automatic timestamps** - Created/updated timestamps on all records
- **UUID primary keys** - Secure, non-sequential identifiers
- **JSON fields** - Flexible storage for product variants and order items
- **Full-text search** - Optimized search across multiple fields

## üîê Security Features

### Authentication
- Integrated with Supabase Auth
- Automatic user profile creation on signup
- Role-based access control (admin, dealer, user)

### Row Level Security Policies
- Users can only see their own data
- Admins have full access to manage all data
- Public read access for products, brands, and categories
- Secure dealer application process

## üõ†Ô∏è Database Operations

All entities now use real database operations:

```typescript
// Example usage
import { Product, Order, DealerApplication } from '@/lib/entities'

// Get featured products
const featuredProducts = await Product.getFeatured()

// Create new order
const newOrder = await Order.createOrder({
  dealer_email: 'dealer@example.com',
  items: [...],
  // ... other fields
})

// Get pending applications
const pendingApps = await DealerApplication.findByStatus('pending')
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Connection Error**: Verify your Supabase URL and API keys in `.env.local`
2. **Permission Denied**: Check if RLS policies are properly configured
3. **Schema Errors**: Ensure you ran the complete `schema.sql` file
4. **Missing Data**: Run the `seed.sql` file to populate sample data

### Useful Supabase Commands:

```sql
-- Check if tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- View sample data
SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 5;
```

## üìà Performance Optimizations

- Indexes on frequently queried fields
- Optimized JSON queries for product variants
- Efficient filtering and sorting
- Connection pooling through Supabase

## üîÑ Migration Path

If you need to modify the schema later:
1. Create new migration files
2. Test in development first
3. Apply to production during maintenance windows
4. Update TypeScript types accordingly

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

Before going live, ensure:
- [ ] Supabase project is created and configured
- [ ] Environment variables are set correctly
- [ ] Database schema is applied successfully
- [ ] Sample data is loaded (optional)
- [ ] Application connects without errors
- [ ] Authentication works properly
- [ ] RLS policies are functioning
- [ ] All CRUD operations work as expected

---

**Your database is now ready for production use!** üéâ

The application will automatically use the real Supabase database instead of mock data. All existing components and pages should work seamlessly with the new database backend.
