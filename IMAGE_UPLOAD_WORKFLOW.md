# Image Upload Workflow Fix

## Issue Fixed
The ProductForm dialog was closing immediately after image upload because buttons in the ImageUploader component were triggering form submission.

## Root Cause
- ImageUploader buttons didn't have `type="button"` attribute
- Default button type in forms is `type="submit"`
- When "Upload All" button was clicked, it triggered the parent form's submit event
- This caused the ProductForm to submit and close the dialog

## Solution Applied
Added `type="button"` to all buttons in ImageUploader component:
- ✅ "Add URL" button
- ✅ "Upload All" button  
- ✅ "Remove image" buttons
- ✅ "Copy URL" buttons

## How Image Upload Should Work Now

### 1. Upload Process
1. **Select Images**: Drag & drop or click to select image files
2. **Preview**: Images appear in preview with "pending" status
3. **Upload**: Click "Upload All" button
4. **Processing**: Images upload to Supabase Storage
5. **Success**: URLs are generated and displayed
6. **Form Update**: URLs are automatically added to form data
7. **Dialog Stays Open**: Form remains open for further editing

### 2. Image Display
- **Existing Images**: Show at top with copy buttons
- **New Images**: Show in upload section with status indicators
- **Successful Uploads**: Display with green checkmark and copy button
- **Failed Uploads**: Show error message in red

### 3. Form Behavior
- ✅ Dialog stays open after image upload
- ✅ Images are added to form data automatically
- ✅ User can continue editing other fields
- ✅ Form only submits when "Save Product" is clicked

## Testing Steps
1. Open product form dialog
2. Upload one or more images
3. Verify dialog stays open
4. Check that images appear in the form
5. Continue editing other fields
6. Submit form only when ready

## Expected Console Output
```
Upload API called
File received: { name: 'image.png', size: 279058, type: 'image/png' }
Auth status: { user: 'Not authenticated', authError: ... }
Using client: Service Role
Upload successful, URL: https://...supabase.co/.../image.png
Updating form with uploaded images: ['https://...supabase.co/.../image.png']
```

The workflow is now fixed and should work as expected!
