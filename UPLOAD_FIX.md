# Image Upload Authentication Fix

## Issue
The image upload is failing with "Auth session missing!" error because:
1. Supabase storage bucket requires authentication for uploads
2. The admin interface doesn't have authentication implemented
3. The storage policies are configured for authenticated users only

## Quick Fix (Development)

To allow anonymous uploads for development, run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Allow anonymous uploads for development
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous uploads for development" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'Jeenmata'
);

-- Temporarily disable the authenticated upload policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated uploads" ON storage.objects;
```

## Production Solution

For production, implement proper authentication:

### Option 1: Simple Admin Authentication

1. Create an admin login page
2. Use Supabase Auth for session management
3. Protect admin routes with authentication middleware

### Option 2: Service Role Key (Server-side only)

Add to your `.env.local`:
```env
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

Then modify the upload function to use service role for server-side uploads.

## Current Status

The upload API has been enhanced with better error logging. Check the terminal for detailed error messages.

## Testing

1. Apply the quick fix SQL above
2. Try uploading an image in the admin panel
3. Check the browser console and terminal for any remaining errors

## Security Note

The quick fix allows anonymous uploads - only use this for development. For production, implement proper authentication.
